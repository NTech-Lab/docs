Troubleshoot Uploads
============================================

Issues with the ``findface-upload`` component result in unavailability of the ``Uploads`` folder content at ``http://<findface_upload_IP:3333/uploads/`` and in the :ref:`FindFace web interface <ffui>`.

.. note::
   The ``Uploads`` folder contains the original images which have been processed by FindFace Server, and the FindFace Server artifacts such as face thumbnails and normalized images.
